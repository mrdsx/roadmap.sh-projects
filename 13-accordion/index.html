        <div class="answer" id="answer1">
          <b>roadmap.sh</b> contains community-curated roadmaps, study plans, paths,
          and resources for developers. There are role-based roadmaps, listing skills
          you should know for any given role, as well as skill-based roadmaps listing items
          to learn for any given skill.

          It started as a set of <a href="https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap">visual charts on GitHub</a>
          to guide developers who are confused about what they should learn next, but then expanded
          into interactive roadmaps where you can click and get resources to learn any given resource,
          contribute by adding new roadmaps, suggest changes to existing roadmaps, track your progress
          as you follow a roadmap and so on.

        <div class="answer" id="answer2">
          Our long-term plan is to make roadmap.sh a go-to place for developers
          whenever they plan on learning something new. We started with roadmaps,
          guides, videos and other visual content but we plan on introducing best practices,
          best-practices for certain tasks, quizzes to test your knowledge and prepare yourself
          for the interviews, project ideas to work on while following the roadmaps, public
          profiles to share your progress and interact with the other learners and so on.
