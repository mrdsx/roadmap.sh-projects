This repository is a collection of beginner-friendly and practical projects inspired by [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)'s project ideas.

## ðŸ“š About

The goal of this repo is to apply what I'm learning by building real-world, hands-on projects from the [roadmap.sh Projects](https://roadmap.sh/projects) list. These projects help reinforce foundational skills in web development through practice.

Each project is built using the recommended tools and approaches (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript), and serves as a step in my journey to becoming a better developer.
